# Mode: apply -- Live Application Assistant

Interactive mode for when the candidate is filling out a job application form in Chrome. Reads what's on screen, loads the offer context, and generates personalized answers for each form question.

## Requirements

- **Best with visible Playwright**: In visible mode, the candidate sees the browser and Claude can interact with the page.
- **Without Playwright**: the candidate shares a screenshot or pastes the questions manually.

## Workflow

```
1. DETECT    → Read active Chrome tab (screenshot/URL/title)
2. IDENTIFY  → Extract company + role from the page
3. LOOK UP   → Match against existing reports in reports/
4. LOAD     → Read full report + Section G (if exists)
5. COMPARE   → Does the role on screen match the evaluated one? If changed → notify
6. ANALYZE  → Identify ALL visible form questions
7. GENERATE  → For each question, generate a personalized answer
8. PRESENT   → Show formatted answers for copy-paste
```

## Step 1 — Detect the Offer

**With Playwright:** Take a snapshot of the active page. Read title, URL, and visible content.

**Without Playwright:** Ask the candidate to:
- Share a screenshot of the form (Read tool reads images)
- Or paste the form questions as text
- Or say company + role so we can look it up

## Step 2 — Identify and Look Up Context

1. Extract company name and role title from the page
2. Search `reports/` by company name (case-insensitive Grep)
3. If there's a match → load the full report
4. If Section G exists → load previous draft answers as base
5. If NO match → notify and offer to run a quick auto-pipeline

## Step 3 — Detect Role Changes

If the role on screen differs from the evaluated one:
- **Notify the candidate**: "The role has changed from [X] to [Y]. Do you want me to re-evaluate or adapt the answers to the new title?"
- **If adapting**: Adjust answers to the new role without re-evaluating
- **If re-evaluating**: Run full A-F evaluation, update report, regenerate Section G
- **Update tracker**: Change role title in applications.md if applicable

## Step 4 — Analyze Form Questions

Identify ALL visible questions:
- Free text fields (cover letter, why this role, etc.)
- Dropdowns (how did you hear, work authorization, etc.)
- Yes/No (relocation, visa, etc.)
- Salary fields (range, expectation)
- Upload fields (resume, cover letter PDF)

Classify each question:
- **Already answered in Section G** → adapt the existing answer
- **New question** → generate answer from report + cv.md

## Step 5 — Generate Answers

For each question, generate the answer following:

1. **Report context**: Use proof points from Block B, STAR stories from Block F
2. **Prior Section G**: If a draft answer exists, use it as base and refine
3. **"I'm choosing you" tone**: Same framework as auto-pipeline
4. **Specificity**: Reference something concrete from the JD visible on screen
5. **career-ops proof point**: Include in "Additional info" if there's a field for it

**Output format:**

```

## Step 6 — Post-apply (optional)

If the candidate confirms they sent the application:
1. Update status in `applications.md` from "Evaluated" to "Applied"
2. Update Section G of the report with final answers
3. Suggest next step: `/career-ops contacto` for LinkedIn outreach

## Scroll Handling

If the form has more questions than are visible:
- Ask the candidate to scroll and share another screenshot
- Or paste the remaining questions
- Process in iterations until the entire form is covered
